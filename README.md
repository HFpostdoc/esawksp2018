# ESA 2018 Workshop: Code cleaning and encapsulation for R and Python

A strong workshop proposal will make clear what knowledge, skills,
tools, or insights participants might expect to gain from the session.

Session title

Analytical code cleaning and encapsulation for R and Python

Session description (appears in the online program only; 250 words
max.)

Have you ever written a long script that conducts oodles of analyses
and wished that someone would come along and make it all clearer to
understand and use? Well you’re not alone. A recent survey of over
1500 scientists reported a crisis of reproducibility with "selective
reporting" being the most cited contributing factor and 80% saying
code availability is playing a role. In this workshop, we'll discuss
common issues in scientific transparency related to analytical
software and train attendees in how to use the **cleanR** and
**encapsulator** packages that have been created to help scientists
more *easily* write and share "cleaner"
code. [cleanR](https://github.com/ProvTools/cleanR) provides a simple
way get the code you need to produce the results you want. uses data
provenance to capture what your code actually does when it’s running
and then allows you to pull out the essential code that produces
specific outputs. By focusing on the results and code you want,
**cleanR** let’s you spend more time on your science and less on
figuring out your
code. [encapsulator](https://github.com/ProvTools/encapsulator)
provides an related tool that also uses provenance to isolate data and
code to create a self contained environment, or "capsule," with all of
the data, code and software dependencies necessary to recreate an
analysis. These tools will enable attendees to apply software and
project curation "best practices" in a manner that leverages the power
of the computational environment in which they're already working.

Summary sentence (appears in print program only; 50 word max.)

Do you write analytical code but struggle to share it with others?
You're not alone. A recent survey of 1500+ scientists reported a
reproducibility crisis with 80% citing inadequate code
transparency. We'll discuss these issues and introduce two packages,
**cleanR** and **encapsulator**, designed to help scientists write and
share code.

Do you have funding to pay for food, beverages, extra A/V equipment,
or other costs of running this workshop? What is the source of the
funding? What expenses would it cover, and for what amount?

No. 

Are there any other sessions proposed for the meeting that this
session should not conflict with?

Not known. 

Is there a session (formal scientific session, business meeting, or
mixer) that this session is intended to immediately precede or follow?

No.
